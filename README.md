# **RR UILib - The UI framework for your fivem server**

This is a new and improved UI resource that is more customizable then my old resource rr_notify. And it also does not only create notification, you can also draw text that stays on the screen until you disable it.

## **Warning !!!!**

If you want this resource to be plug and play please download the newst version from releases. The code here is the source code and should only be used for development purposes

<br>

## **Features**

This script currently has 2 ui components.

1. Notify | Notifications
2. DrawText

The notifications come with a wide variaty of options so you can change everything to your liking.

### **Simple Notification**

The simple notifcation handles the style and icons for you by default. This is a way simpler way of sending messages that needs less arguments. If you need something more customizable then I recommend going for the normal message function

<br>

#### **How to use:**

Through exports:

`Clientsided`

```lua
-- msgType: string
--  -options: success, error, warning, primary, default
-- msg: string
-- useSound | optional: boolean
exports.rr_uilib:NotifyS(msgType, msg, useSound)
```

`Serversided`

```lua
-- source: number
-- msgType: string
--  -options: success, error, warning, primary, default
-- msg: string
-- useSound | optional: boolean
exports.rr_uilib:NotifyS(source, msgType, msg, useSound)
```

Through event:

```lua
-- source: number
-- msgType: string
--  -options: success, error, warning, primary, default
-- msg: string
-- useSound | optional: boolean
TriggerClientEvent("rr_uilib:NotifyS", source, msgType, msg, useSound)
```

### **Notifications**

#### **How to use:**

Through exports:

`Clientsided`

```lua
exports.rr_uilib:Notify(data)

`Serversided`

```lua
exports.rr_uilib:Notify(source, data)
```

Through event:

```lua
TriggerClientEvent("rr_uilib:Notify", source, data)

#### **Properties:**

The properties are send through the data object. This data object can contain the following options:

**Message**

```lua
local data = {
  msg = "This is a test message" -- Required
}

The default option is a white background with the icon colored

**Type**
As you can see on the images above, all the types are displayed. The order of the options below is the same as visible on the images. This will give you an idea how the different types look.

```lua
local data = {
  type = "default"
}
```

Options: `"success", "error", "primary", "default", "warning`

**Icon**
The icon uses the [fontawesome 6.0.0](https://fontawesome.com/icons) free icons. You just have to add the classes of the icon you want into the icon option.

```lua
local data = {
  icon = "fa-solid fa-vial"
}
```

```lua
local data = {
  position = "top-right"
}
```

Options: `"top-left", "top-center", "top-right", "bottom-left", "bottom-center", "bottom-right"`
**Duration**

```lua
local data = {
  duration = 1000 -- Time in milliseconds
}
```

**Sound**
You can import your .mp3 files into the web/public/sounds path. To retrieve them, simply enter the file name in the sound field as in the example below.Instead the volume field is used to set the sound volume.

```lua
local data = {
  sound = "soundName",
  volume = 0.1 -- Optional / Default 0.5
}
```

Options: `"success", "info", "error"`

### **DrawText**

<br>

#### **How to use:**

```lua

```

**Draw**

```lua
local data = {
  draw = true -- Required
}
```

If you want to disable the text you have drawn you can simply do that by triggering the DrawText function and just sending data.draw as false.

Like this

```lua
exports.rr_uilib:DrawText({draw = false})
```
